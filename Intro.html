    <p>
        One day morning, ryunhan was walking on the road near his home, seoulib.
        He <strong>suddenly</strong> noticed that it is so unusual to walk on the road in the morning.
        Because Ryunhan usually wakes up late and even more late to come out from his home.

        Now, I think you may want to know how ryunhan looks like!

        Wow!!!! Right, he is sooo cute :) And also you may infer the important fact about him.
        <strong>He loves donggas....</strong> In fact, his eyes are far smaller than this.
        However, because he is waiting for his donggas <u>(especially at Jeongdon)</u> his eyes became bigger!!!
        <br><br>
        Maybe you can feel <strong>such a shame!</strong> Because I think you want more pictures of him.
        So, here is only one more picture!! This is very exciting one, so enjoy.
        You can see him like this by saying "Your eyes are small!"
        Never mind, actually I like his small eyes and this is not teasing :))
